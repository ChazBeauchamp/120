   <h1>Chaz Beauchamp</h1>
   <p>For Spring Break 2024 I took a five day trip to London. I had never 
      been there before and enjoyed exploring a new city. My favorite part
      of the trip was visiting Wimbledon stadium.

      My Favorite Restaurant, Olive Garden</a>
   <p>As someone who loves virtually all forms of Italian food, I really
      enjoyed going to Olive Garden as a kid. My favorite dish was the 
      Fettucini Alfredo, along with however many breadsticks I could manage
      to get my hands on. Unfortunately, it's been about four years since
      I last had the chance to go.

      Under normal circumstances, my favorite food is Fettucini Alfredo, but
      since I've adopted a low-carb way of eating my new #1 has been Ribeye
      steaks. I like to cook them anywhere between medium and medium-rare. I
      typically only season with salt and use the broiler to get them done
      within 15 minutes.
